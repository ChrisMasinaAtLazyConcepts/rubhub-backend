 Dynamic wingtips, a seamless variable-camber leading edge, a continuous morphing trailing edge, 
 and an aeroelastically tailored composite structure. The shape transforms from a high-camber, 
 large-area, splayed-tip wing for low speed to a sleek, slender, smoothly contoured, and 
 slightly adaptive wing for cruise—truly embodying the principle of "the right shape for the 
 right flight phase." This is the holy grail of aerodynamic efficiency, taking us from rigid,
